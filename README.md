# rpidashcam
Dashcam software designed to run on Raspberry Pi.


## Requirements
* USB microphone or similar
* USB GPS module
* External storage
* Camera module (HQ camera prefered but should work with any other camera).

### 720p
Tested with Raspberry Pi 3B+ and working fine.

### 1080p
Kind of works with Raspberry Pi 3B+. It sometimes lags though. I suspect CPU/GPU throttling because of heat since I lack heat sinks/cooling.
